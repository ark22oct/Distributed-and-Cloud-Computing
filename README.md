# Distributed and Cloud Computing

Lab work and final project for Distributed and Cloud Computing accomplished using Python, Decision Trees (ML), FastAPI, Flask, Docker, and Azure. Feel free to reference, but avoid copying.

Delving into concepts in the design and implementation of large-scale distributed/cloud computing systems. Topics ranging from cloud technology to cluster and multi-core systems. 
Specifically cloud infrastructures, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, distributed storage systems, and programming models.

# Project (Cross Continental Transportation System) Overview
The Cross Continent Transportation System project aims to address challenges faced in the logistics sector, particularly in cross-continental transport. With globalization and e-commerce driving the demand for efficient transportation solutions, there is a need for systems that can optimize routes, select suitable transportation methods, and accurately predict delivery dates. This project proposes the use of machine learning, specifically decision trees, to enhance transportation methods by considering factors such as distance, urgency, and cost.

## Methodology
The project involves several key stages:

1. **Creation of Dataset:** Generating a substantial dataset containing variables such as distance, importance, transportation cost, fuel efficiency, pollution, and volume of goods to transport.
2. **Development of Decision Tree Model:** Utilizing machine learning algorithms to create a decision tree model that improves transportation methods by considering factors like distance, cost, and urgency during training.
3. **Application Development:** Developing the application using Python, with the Flask framework considered for web deployment. The app combines the decision tree model and offers a user-friendly interface for users to input their 
     transportation requirements.
4. **Decision Tree Integration:** Integrating the decision tree model into the application, providing input data to the model, and using Python libraries to display its structure.
